### Hey there, here is a few things about me and my coding life. ðŸ‘‹

I have been working hard to develop my coding skills over the last few years but the more I learn, the more I find there is to learn and that is exciting. I am developing a mentality to learn in the open and blog ([https://dev.to/neosaurrrus](https://dev.to/neosaurrrus) ) what I have learnt, which is something I would have been terrified of a couple of years ago.

Some other things you might want to know about me:

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m looking for new roles!
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently re-learning Python and having fun with Svelte
- ðŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on projects help make the web more accessible to the world.
- ðŸ¤” Iâ€™m looking for help with test-driven development techniques that work in componentized
- ðŸ’¬ Ask me about accessibility, React, Svelte
- ðŸ“« How to reach me: @lukie_k on Twitter is good enough.
- ðŸ˜„ Pronouns: He/His
- âš¡ Fun fact: I once drove from the UK to Mongolia in  an 23 year old Nissan Micra.
