### Hey there, here is a few things about me and my coding life. ðŸ‘‹


I have a number of web apps I have built from conception to deployment mostly using React, but also Ruby and NodeJS among other technologies. To keep things brief here, I have my favourites on my portfolio site ([https://lukiekang.com](https://lukiekang.com/)

I have been working hard to develop my coding skills over the last few years but the more I learn, the more I find there is to learn and that is exciting. I am developing a mentality to learn in the open and blog ([https://dev.to/neosaurrrus](https://dev.to/neosaurrrus) ) what I have learnt, which is something I would have been terrified of a couple of years ago.


Some other things you might want to know about me:

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on a brief report into accessibility in UK news organisations
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning Gatsby and usage of headless CMS's
- ðŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on projects help make the web more accessible to the world.
- ðŸ¤” Iâ€™m looking for help with test-driven development techniques
- ðŸ’¬ Ask me about accessibility, React
- ðŸ“« How to reach me: @lukie_k on Twitter is good enough.
- ðŸ˜„ Pronouns: He/His
- âš¡ Fun fact: I once drove from the UK to Mongolia in  an 18year old Nissan Micra.
