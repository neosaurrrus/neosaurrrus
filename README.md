### Hey there, here is a few things about me and my coding life. 👋

I have been working hard to develop my coding skills over the last few years but the more I learn, the more I find there is to learn and that is exciting. I am developing a mentality to learn in the open and blog ([https://dev.to/neosaurrrus](https://dev.to/neosaurrrus) ) what I have learnt, which is something I would have been terrified of a couple of years ago.

Some other things you might want to know about me:

- 🔭 I’m currently working on a brief report into accessibility in UK news organisations
- 🌱 I’m currently learning Gatsby and usage of headless CMS's
- 👯 I’m looking to collaborate on projects help make the web more accessible to the world.
- 🤔 I’m looking for help with test-driven development techniques
- 💬 Ask me about accessibility, React
- 📫 How to reach me: @lukie_k on Twitter is good enough.
- 😄 Pronouns: He/His
- ⚡ Fun fact: I once drove from the UK to Mongolia in  an 23 year old Nissan Micra.
